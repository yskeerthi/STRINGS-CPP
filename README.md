# C++ String Methods and Algorithms

This repository contains examples of basic to advanced string operations in C++ along with key algorithms like Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) and Rabin-Karp for pattern matching.

## Structure

- **Basic String Operations**: Initialization, Length, Accessing characters, Concatenation.
- **Intermediate String Operations**: Inserting, Replacing, Finding substrings, Comparing strings.
- **Advanced String Operations**: Pattern matching algorithms (KMP, Rabin-Karp), C-style string conversion.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository using `git clone https://github.com/your-username/cpp-string-methods.git`
2. Navigate to the specific folders (basic, intermediate, advanced) for code examples.
3. Compile and run each `.cpp` file using a C++ compiler, for example:

   ```bash
   g++ basic/string_initialization.cpp -o string_init
   ./string_init
